/**
 * Model for a blogen Post. A Post in Blogen will either be a "Parent" post or a "child" post. A parent post can have
 * any number of child posts, but we only go one level deep. That is to say, you can reply to a Parent post, but you
 * cannot reply to a child post. This is by design to keep the model as simple as possible.
